# NILA – Implementation Tasks & Development Checklist

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines all major implementation tasks for the Nila platform.
It provides a structured, end-to-end checklist for backend and frontend developers to follow while building the system.

The goal is to ensure:

* No major feature is missed

## Final Execution Principle

Developers must follow this order:
Database → Backend → Integrations → Frontend

No feature is considered complete unless:

* Database schema supports it
* Backend APIs exist
* Business rules are enforced
* Flows work end-to-end
